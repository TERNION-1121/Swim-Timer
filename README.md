<h1 align="center">Swim Timer</h1>

A *Timing System for Swimming*[^1] made in Python.

## `class EVENT()`
This class houses the event details, such as:
- Event Number
- Heat Number
- Event Type
- Event Distance
- Event Gender, etc.

For the sake of simplicity, rather than having 8 swimmer lanes, the project has 4 swimmer lanes.
